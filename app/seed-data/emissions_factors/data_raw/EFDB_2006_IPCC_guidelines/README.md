## Description
EFDB is a database on various parameters to be used in calculation of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases. It covers not only the so-called "emission factors" but also the other relevant parameters. For convenience sake, however, the term "Emission Factor" or its abbreviation "EF" is sometimes used to represent parameters in this database generally.
