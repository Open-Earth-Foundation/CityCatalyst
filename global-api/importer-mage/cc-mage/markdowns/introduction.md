# Industrial Products Statistics - INDEC

The information originates from different sources: INDEC's own surveys, data from other government agencies and information from business institutions. In the case of some products (wine, beer, soft drinks, cigarettes, cement, boats), to make up for the lack of production statistics or to complement them, figures for registrations, sales or shipments of national products are recorded.
