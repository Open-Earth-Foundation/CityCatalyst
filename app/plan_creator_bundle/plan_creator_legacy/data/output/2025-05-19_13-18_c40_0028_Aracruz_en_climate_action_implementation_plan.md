# Climate Action Implementation Plan
**City:** Aracruz<br>
**Climate action:** Zero Emission Buses

Aracruz, located in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, is a city with a population of approximately 94,765 residents. It spans an area of 1,612 square kilometers and is characterized by a tropical rainforest biome. The city faces significant environmental challenges, including high transportation emissions, which contribute to its total greenhouse gas emissions of 664,906.347 tons annually.

The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative aims to transform Aracruz's public transportation system by integrating electric or other zero-emission technologies into its bus fleet. This action is crucial for reducing the city's transportation emissions, which currently stand at 170,627.655 tons. By promoting cleaner air and sustainable urban transit, the initiative not only addresses environmental concerns but also enhances public health and equity, particularly benefiting underserved communities.

This initiative aligns with Brazil's national climate strategy, which emphasizes a just and inclusive transition to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Brazil's National Mitigation Strategy supports decarbonization across all sectors, including transportation, to achieve its climate goals. The transition to zero-emission buses in Aracruz is a step towards fulfilling Brazil's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development.
