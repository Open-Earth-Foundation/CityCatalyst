"""
The ml_comparator is a function that compares two actions based on the given city data and action details.

Inputs:
- city: dict
- action_A: dict
- action_B: dict

Outputs:
- int: 1 if action A is preferred, -1 if action B is preferred.

The following fields are being used for the comparison:
Actions:
- Hazard
- CoBenefits
- GHGReductionPotential
- AdaptationEffectiveness
- CostInvestmentNeeded
- TimelineForImplementation

City:
- PopulationSize
- PopulationDensity
- Elevation
- StationaryEnergyEmissions
- TransportationEmissions
- WasteEmissions
- ippuEmissions
- afoluEmissions
- CCRA

After the transformation, the following fields are being used for the comparison:
- [action_GHGReductionPotential, city_stationaryEnergyEmissions, city_transportationEmissions, city_wasteEmissions, city_ippuEmissions, city_afoluEmissions] > EmissionReduction_Percentage_Diff
- CostInvestmentNeeded > CostInvestmentNeeded_Diff
- TimelineForImplementation > TimelineForImplementation_Diff
- [Hazard,AdaptationEffectiveness, CCRA] > weighted_risk_score_diff
- CoBenefits > CoBenefits_Diff_air_quality
- CoBenefits > CoBenefits_Diff_water_quality
- CoBenefits > CoBenefits_Diff_habitat
- CoBenefits > CoBenefits_Diff_cost_of_living
- CoBenefits > CoBenefits_Diff_housing
- CoBenefits > CoBenefits_Diff_mobility
- CoBenefits > CoBenefits_Diff_stakeholder_engagement
- (biome_tropical_rainforest) >>> being skipped in one hot encoding to prevent multicollinearity
- Biome > biome_temperate_forest
- Biome > biome_desert
- Biome > biome_grassland_savanna
- Biome > biome_tundra
- Biome > biome_wetlands
- Biome > biome_mountains
- Biome > biome_boreal_forest_taiga

- ActionType > actionA_adaptation
- ActionType > actionB_mitigation
- ActionType > actionB_adaptation
- PopulationSize > city_populationSize
- PopulationDensity > city_populationDensity

Raises:
    The function will raise an error if the dataframe is empty due to missing values.
    The function will raise an error if the action types are not valid.
