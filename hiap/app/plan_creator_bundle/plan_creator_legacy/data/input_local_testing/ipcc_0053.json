    "Description": "Activities focused on converting land to forests, restoring degraded forests, and prioritizing ecological integrity. Afforestation targets historically non-forested land, while reforestation targets previously forested areas. Efforts include enhancing biodiversity, improving ecosystem services, and increasing carbon sequestration.",
    "BehavioralChangeTargeted": "Encourages sustainable land management, restoration of degraded ecosystems, and adoption of forest-friendly agricultural practices.",
