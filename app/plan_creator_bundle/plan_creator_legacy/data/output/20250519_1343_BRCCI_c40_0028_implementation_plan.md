# Climate Action Implementation Plan
**City:** Camaçari, Bahia, Brazil<br>
**Climate action:** Zero Emission Buses

Camaçari, located in the state of Bahia, Brazil, is a vibrant city with a population of approximately 300,372 residents. Situated in a tropical rainforest biome, the city covers an area of 758.73 square kilometers and is characterized by its diverse socio-economic landscape, with a significant portion of its population being low-income. The city faces various climate-related challenges, including high risks of heatwaves, flooding, and landslides, which impact public health and infrastructure.

The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative aims to transform Camaçari's public transportation system by integrating electric or other zero-emission technologies into its bus fleet. This action is crucial for reducing the city's transportation emissions, which currently stand at 295,693,000 metric tons. By transitioning to zero-emission buses, Camaçari will not only improve air quality but also promote equity and inclusion by providing cleaner transportation options to underserved communities. The initiative is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector by 20-39%, contributing to a more sustainable urban environment.

This climate action aligns with Brazil's national climate strategy, which emphasizes the electrification of the transportation sector as a key component of its National Mitigation Strategy. Brazil aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and the adoption of zero-emission buses is a significant step towards this goal. The national strategy supports the transition to electric vehicles through regulatory transformations and investments in infrastructure, ensuring that cities like Camaçari can effectively implement such initiatives. By aligning with these national objectives, Camaçari's Zero Emission Buses initiative not only contributes to local sustainability but also supports Brazil's broader climate commitments.
