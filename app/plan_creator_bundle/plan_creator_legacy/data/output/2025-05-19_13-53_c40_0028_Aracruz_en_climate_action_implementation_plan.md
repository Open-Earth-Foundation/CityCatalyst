# Climate Action Implementation Plan
**City:** Aracruz<br>
**Climate action:** Zero Emission Buses

Aracruz, located in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, is a city with a population of approximately 94,765 residents. It spans an area of 1,612 square kilometers and is characterized by a tropical rainforest biome. The city faces significant environmental challenges, including high transportation emissions, which contribute to its total greenhouse gas emissions of 664,906.347 tons annually.

The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative aims to transform Aracruz's public transportation system by integrating electric or other zero-emission technologies into its bus fleet. This action is crucial for reducing the city's transportation emissions, which currently stand at 170,627.655 tons. By promoting cleaner air and sustainable urban transit, the initiative not only targets greenhouse gas reduction but also enhances public health and equity, particularly benefiting underserved communities.

This initiative aligns with Brazil's national climate strategy, which emphasizes a just and inclusive transition to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Brazil's strategy focuses on integrating scientific evidence and promoting decarbonization across all sectors, including transportation. The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative in Aracruz supports these national goals by contributing to the reduction of emissions and fostering sustainable development in line with Brazil's commitment to the Paris Agreement and its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
