# Climate Action Implementation Plan
**City:** Camaçari<br>
**Climate action:** Zero Emission Buses

Camaçari, located in the state of Bahia, Brazil, is a vibrant city with a population of approximately 300,372 residents. Situated in a tropical rainforest biome, the city covers an area of 758.73 square kilometers and is characterized by a high population density. Camaçari faces significant socio-economic challenges, with a very high percentage of low-income residents, and is vulnerable to climate-related hazards such as heatwaves and flooding.

The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative aims to transform Camaçari's public transportation system by integrating electric or other zero-emission technologies into its bus fleet. This initiative is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector, which currently accounts for a significant portion of the city's total emissions. By promoting cleaner air and sustainable urban transit, the initiative not only addresses environmental concerns but also enhances public health and equity, particularly benefiting underserved communities.

This climate action aligns with Brazil's national climate strategy, which emphasizes the transition to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Brazil's National Mitigation Strategy supports the electrification of the transportation sector as a key measure to reduce emissions. The strategy also highlights the importance of sustainable urban development and improving public transport to decrease reliance on individual vehicles. By adopting zero-emission buses, Camaçari contributes to the national goal of reducing transportation emissions and supports Brazil's commitment to international climate agreements.
