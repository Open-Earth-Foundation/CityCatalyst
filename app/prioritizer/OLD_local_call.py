"""
This file is the main file for the prioritizer.
It is used to prioritize climate actions for a given city.

It uses the following files:
- reading_writing_data.py: for reading and writing data to files
- additional_scoring_functions.py: for additional scoring functions
- prompt.py: for the prompt
- ml_comparator.py: for the ML comparator
- get_actions.py: for getting the actions from the API

Usage:
python prioritizer.py --locode <locode>

Example:
Run it from the /app folder of the project with the following command:

python -m prioritizer.local_call
