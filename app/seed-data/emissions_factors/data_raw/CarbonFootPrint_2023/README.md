# Carbon Foot Print

The international country level grid electricity factors are suitable for organisations reporting their carbon emissions. These emissions factors have been collated from numerous sources by [Carbon Footprint Ltd](https://www.carbonfootprint.com/) to make it easier for organisations and individuals to measure and report their emissions from international electricity sources.

## Description
The emissions factors provided here can be used in calculating GHG emissions from electrity usage. Many of the factors are provided for leading international sources, where factors are not readily and freely available Carbon Footprint Ltd has calculated the factors from the fuel mix used to generate the electricity in that country. The carbon emissions per kWh of electricity vary from country to country. They depend on the specific fuels used to make the energy. Countries that use a high percentage of fossil fuels for electricity production will, in general, have a higher level of carbon emissions per unit of electricity produced than those that use more renewable and nuclear energy. The factors are built into the carbon calculator tools on the [website](https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator1.html)
