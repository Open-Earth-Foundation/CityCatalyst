mitigation = """
The following gives an overview of the different climate mitigation sectors.

There are 5 sectors according to the 'Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhous Gas Inventories' (GPC):
- **Stationary Energy**,
- **Transportation**,
- **Waste"**
- **Industrial Process And Product Use (IPPU)**
- **Agriculture, Forestry and other Land Use (AFOLU)**

The following is a description of the different sectors:
- Stationary Energy: 
    Stationary energy sources are one of the largest contributors to a city's GHG emissions.
    These emissions come from the combustion of fuel in residential, commercial and
    institutional buildings and facilities and manufacturing industries and construction, as well
    as power plants to generate grid-supplied energy. This sector also includes fugitive
    emissions, which typically occur during extraction, transformation, and transportation of
    primary fossil fuels.

- Transportation:
    Transportation covers all journeys by road, rail, water and air, including inter-city and
    international travel. GHG emissions are produced directly by the combustion of fuel or
    indirectly by the use of grid-supplied electricity. 

- Waste:
    Waste disposal and treatment produces GHG emissions through aerobic or anaerobic
    decomposition, or incineration. GHG emissions from solid waste shall be calculated by disposal
    route, namely landfill, biological treatment and incineration and open burning. If methane is
    recovered from solid waste or wastewater treatment facilities as an energy source, it shall be
    reported under Stationary Energy. Similarly, emissions from incineration with energy recovery
    are reported under Stationary Energy.

- Industrial Process And Product Use (IPPU):
    GHG emissions are produced from a wide variety of non-energy related industrial activities.
    The main emission sources are releases from industrial processes that chemically or physically
    transform materials (e.g., the blast furnace in the iron and steel industry, and ammonia and
    other chemical products manufactured from fossil fuels and used as chemical feedstock).
    During these processes many different GHGs can be produced. In addition, certain products
    used by industry and end-consumers, such as refrigerants, foams or aerosol cans, also contain
    GHGs which can be released during use and disposal.

- Agriculture, Forestry and other Land Use (AFOLU):
    Emissions and removals from the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector are
    produced through a variety of pathways, including livestock (enteric fermentation and manure
    management), land use and land use change (e.g., forested land being cleared for cropland
    or settlements), and aggregate sources and non-CO2 emission sources on land (e.g., fertilizer
    application and rice cultivation).
