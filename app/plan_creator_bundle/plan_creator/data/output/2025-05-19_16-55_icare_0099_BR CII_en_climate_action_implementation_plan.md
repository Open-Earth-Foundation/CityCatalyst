# Climate Action Implementation Plan
**City:** Cariacica<br>
**Climate action:** Support Agroecological Certification Programs

Cariacica, located in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, is a city characterized by its tropical rainforest biome. With a population density of 1,263.74 people per square kilometer and a total area of 320 square kilometers, Cariacica is a vibrant urban center. Despite its relatively small population size, the city faces significant challenges related to transportation emissions, which contribute to its total greenhouse gas emissions.

The climate action plan focuses on supporting agroecological certification programs, a mitigation strategy aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the agriculture, forestry, and fishing sectors. By encouraging the certification of agroecological products that meet sustainability criteria, the city aims to promote low environmental impact practices. This initiative is crucial for Cariacica, as it aligns with the city's need to address emissions and improve air and water quality, while also enhancing habitat preservation and stakeholder engagement.

This climate action is in harmony with Brazil's national climate strategy, which emphasizes a just and inclusive transition to a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions economy by 2050. Brazil's strategy prioritizes the integration of social and environmental sustainability across all sectors, promoting decarbonization and the use of scientific evidence in climate policy. By supporting agroecological certification, Cariacica contributes to the national goal of reducing emissions and fostering sustainable development, while also addressing local socio-economic challenges.
