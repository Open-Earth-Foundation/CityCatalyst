# Custom polygons from cities

Cities may have their own boundaries that should overwrite the open street maps, this must run after osm to update boundaries and before any joins to data sources.

1. Save the database URI to an environment variable named `DB_URI`

2. Run the script 

```bash
python ./custom_polygons/custom_polygon_importer.py
```

Use the following to to create an envionrment variable in `zsh`:

```sh
export DB_URI="postgresql://ccglobal:@localhost/ccglobal"
```
