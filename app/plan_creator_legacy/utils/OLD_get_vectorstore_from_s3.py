# plan_creator_legacy/utils/get_vectorstore_from_s3.py

"""
This module provides functionality to download a vector store from S3 and check if it is valid.

Args:
    collection_name: Name of the collection to download
    path: Path to store the vector store (relative to project root)

Returns:
    bool: True if vector store exists locally or was successfully downloaded

Example:
    >>> get_vectorstore("my_collection", "vector_stores")
    True
