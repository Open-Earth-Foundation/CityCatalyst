# IPCC Emissions Factor Database (EFDB)

Emission factors from the [2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html) were selected from the [emission factor database](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/EFDB/main.php).

## Description
EFDB is a database on various parameters to be used in calculation of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases. It covers not only the so-called "emission factors" but also the other relevant parameters. For convenience sake, however, the term "Emission Factor" or its abbreviation "EF" is sometimes used to represent parameters in this database generally.
