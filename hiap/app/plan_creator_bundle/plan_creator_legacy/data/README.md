The `city_data.json` file gets created in this repository: `https://github.com/Open-Earth-Foundation/Climate-Action-Prioritization`

It gets created by running the scripts inside `/scripts/upload_to_frontend` for creating `city_data.json`.

This file is needed for the legacy implementation of the plan creator.
