3. Review the introduction for the climate action implementation plan.
4. Inspect the provided additional context to climate risks (hazards).
5. Based on the provided information, list all climate risks (hazards) that are relevant and addressed by the climate action. Include a brief description of how they are addressed by the climate action.
**Important**: It is possible, that a climate action does not address any of the listed climate risks (hazards). This can happen for example, when the climate action primarily aims at mitigating emissions. In this case, state this fact briefly.
</task>

<output>
The final output should include: 
- a headline
- a bullet point list containing climate risks (hazards) with a brief descriptions of how they are addressed.
