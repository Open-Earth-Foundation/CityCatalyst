# Climate Action Implementation Plan
**City:** Maranguape<br>
**Climate action:** Zero Emission Buses

Maranguape, located in the state of Ceará, Brazil, is a city with a population of approximately 105,093 residents. The city spans an area of 590 square kilometers and is characterized by a desert biome. Maranguape faces significant climate challenges, including high risks of droughts and heatwaves, which impact water resources, food security, and public health.

The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative aims to integrate electric or other zero-emission technologies into Maranguape's public transportation fleet. This strategy is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector, which currently accounts for a significant portion of the city's emissions. By transitioning to zero-emission buses, Maranguape can improve air quality, promote sustainable urban transit, and enhance accessibility to clean transportation for all community members, including low-income individuals.

This initiative aligns with Brazil's national climate strategy, which emphasizes reducing emissions in the transportation sector. The national strategy includes goals for transitioning to zero-emission vehicles and investing in sustainable infrastructure. The implementation of zero-emission buses in Maranguape supports these national objectives by contributing to the reduction of transportation emissions and promoting environmental justice through equitable access to clean transit solutions.

## Subactions:

1. **Set a Target Year for Transition**: Establish a clear target year for the full transition to zero-emission buses. This will guide the city's actions and signal demand to bus suppliers and operators.

2. **Conduct Feasibility Studies**: Perform in-depth feasibility studies to explore technology and financing options for zero-emission buses. This includes assessing the availability of electric or zero-emission bus technology and the necessary infrastructure.

3. **Engage Stakeholders**: Collaborate with utility companies, bus suppliers, and capital providers to ensure the availability of necessary technology and infrastructure. Early engagement with manufacturers is crucial to understand product availability.

4. **Pilot Program Implementation**: Initiate a pilot program to test the deployment of zero-emission buses. This will help identify potential challenges and refine the implementation strategy.

5. **Procurement and Financing**: Explore various procurement options such as outright purchase, leasing, or joint purchasing. Secure public funding or financial incentives to support the transition.

6. **Infrastructure Development**: Invest in charging infrastructure for electric buses. This includes planning for overnight-charging facilities and on-route opportunity charging stations.

7. **Training and Workforce Development**: Develop training programs for drivers and maintenance staff to ensure they are equipped to operate and maintain the new zero-emission buses.

8. **Staggered Introduction of Buses**: Gradually introduce zero-emission buses into the fleet to ensure a smooth transition. This allows for adjustments based on performance analysis and feedback.

9. **Performance Monitoring and Analysis**: Continuously monitor the performance of the zero-emission buses and infrastructure. Use key performance indicators to assess progress and make necessary adjustments.

10. **Public Engagement and Awareness**: Promote public acceptance and demand for cleaner public transportation options through awareness campaigns highlighting the benefits of zero-emission buses.

11. **Policy and Regulation Support**: Work with government bodies to establish supportive policies and regulations that promote zero-emission transportation and provide incentives for adoption.
