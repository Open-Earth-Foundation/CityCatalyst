# Climate Action Implementation Plan
**City:** Maranguape<br>
**Climate action:** Afforestation, Reforestation and Forest Ecosystem Restoration

Maranguape, located in the state of Ceará, Brazil, is a city with a population of approximately 105,093 residents. The city spans an area of 590 square kilometers and is characterized by a desert biome. Maranguape faces significant climate challenges, including high risks of droughts impacting water resources, food security, and energy security, as well as heatwaves affecting public health.

The primary climate action for Maranguape is afforestation, reforestation, and forest ecosystem restoration. This initiative aims to convert land to forests, restore degraded forests, and enhance ecological integrity. By increasing carbon sequestration and improving biodiversity, this action addresses the city's high land use emissions and contributes to mitigating the impacts of climate change. The initiative also supports local livelihoods and promotes sustainable land management practices, which are crucial for Maranguape's socio-economic development.

This climate action aligns with Brazil's national climate strategy, which emphasizes the restoration of native vegetation as a key component of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Brazil's strategy includes the National Plan for the Recovery of Native Vegetation (PLANAVEG) and the "Arc of Restoration in the Amazon," which aim to restore millions of hectares of forest and contribute to the country's goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. These efforts are part of Brazil's broader commitment to climate justice, promoting social and environmental sustainability while addressing climate change.
